          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Income</h2>
          <p>In the scatter plot chart above, we are investigating the relationships between demographic
             information and health risk (lack of healthcare vs. poverty rate). The data collected was 
             from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
              System for the year of 2014. Each point in the scatter represents a state (hover over point for 
              more information). The scatter plot shows a positive correlation between rate of lack of healthcare
               and poverty.</p>

          <p>The trend shows that as rate of poverty increases, so does the rate of lack of healthcare. 
            Some of the southern states lead in the trend and that can be explained by the affordability 
            of healthcare product products whereas states like New York and California have high income rate 
            that can afford the healthcare product. The outlier in this scatter plot would be Texas. States 
            with the similar rate of poverty to Texas would have around 17%  rate of lack of healthcare 
            product. And Massachusetts has the lowest poverty and lack of healthcare rate which can be 
            explained that it has passed a health care reform law in 2006 with the aim of providing health 
            insurance to nearly all of its residents. </p>
